# Shared makefiles

In this directory there will be different make scripts which can be used in other project by simply including them as a copy.

## Naming
All makefiles should use an unique and intuitive name. Also all defined goals should be prefixed with the makefile name.

## Self-update
To keep these project copies up-to-date all makefiles should have a self-update goal.
